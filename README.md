This approach is build upon the DEEP-PSMA baseline algorithm.
The DEEP-PSMA folder was used for model training. The DEEP-PSMA-Algorithm for building the docker.

To improve the FDG-segmentations, we added postprocessing.py to the DEEP-PSMA-Algorithm folder. These postprocessing functions are used in inference.py
